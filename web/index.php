            <p>JPO is a program that helps you organise your digital pictures by putting them in
                collections. You can browse, reorganise and find your pictures in the collections.
                It doesn't mess with pictures on your disk; they stay where they are and how they are.</p>

            <p>JPO can generate webpages for you and you can use it to tidy up your picture directories.
                It has over 12 years of development in it, runs on any computer that runs Java
                and is entirely Open Source.</p>

            <h2 id="Techdes">Technical description</h2>
            <p>The Java Picture Organizer application is a platform independent image organisation tool
                that lets a user build collections of images that they can then search, browse,
                show and share with others. An HTML export facility is available that allows
                web pages to be built from collections. JPO uses an open XML file format to store
                collection information. Picture groups can be exported to a directory for CD burning
                and sharing by other means. JPO supports all picture formats of your Java installation.
                By default this is JPEG and GIF. The application makes use of Sun's Java Web Start (TM)
                technology for easy installation and upgrading.</p>
