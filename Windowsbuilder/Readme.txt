How to build the Windows Executable.

Install NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) on a Windows PC. Then Start the program and go to the
Compiler where you start MakeNSISW.
This opens a GUI where you open the jpoexe.nsi script.
It immediately compiles it and creates a Jpo.exe program
Then open the script jpo.nsi which creates the Jpo-Installer.exe program
Done.

See http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis

Note: You do need Java installed on the Windows PC.
