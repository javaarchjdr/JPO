        <h1>Introduction.</h1>

        <p>The Java Picture Organizer application is a platform independent image organisation tool 
            that lets a user build collections of images that they can then search, browse, 
            show and share with others. An HTML export facility is available that allows 
            web pages to be built from collections. Emails with pictures can be sent, pictures can
            be uploaded to Picasa or located on a Google Map. JPO uses an open XML file format to store 
            collection information. Picture groups can be exported to a directory for CD burning 
            and sharing by other means. JPO supports all picture formats of your Java installation. 
            The application makes use of Java Web Start (TM) technology for easy installation and upgrading.</p>
